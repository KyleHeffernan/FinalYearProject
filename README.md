# FinalYearProject

I will be designing my project in Unity and decided to use the standard render pipeline for now as I work on some more basic concepts, as I can always upgrade it to the universal render pipeline later.

I created a 3d project using the standard render pipeline and imported a snaps prototype asset pack. This pack contains a collection of prefabs to help in make a prototype scene quickly.


Current research:

This HSE has a lot of info and reading material about the virus and the factors that lead to its spread. Things like the time it takes for the virus to spread, how long the virus can last on surfaces and how far
the virus can travel on water droplets. I imagine these will be useful when I am coding the virus behaviours.

A video with an epidemic simulation that has similar concepts to my idea. The people are oval shaped blobs that travel around the map following walkable paths. They are coloured blue when they are susceptible, turn
red when they are infectious and then turn gray when they recover. There is also a graph displayed with the amount of susceptible/infectious/recoved people as time goes on. In this simulation, you can also change
the infection duration and see how that effects the infection rate.
