# FinalYearProject

I will be designing my project in Unity and decided to use the standard render pipeline for now as I work on some more basic concepts, as I can always upgrade it to the universal render pipeline later.

I created a 3d project using the standard render pipeline and imported a snaps prototype asset pack. This pack contains a collection of prefabs to help in make a prototype scene quickly.
